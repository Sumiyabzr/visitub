For centuries, this magnificent breed has been an indispensable companion to the Mongolian people, facilitating their nomadic lifestyle, trade, and warfare. The Mongolian horse, also known as the Mongol horse or Mongolian pony, is a small yet robust breed, well-adapted to the harsh and demanding terrain of the Mongolian steppes. Its compact size, hardy constitution, and incredible agility allow it to navigate through rugged landscapes with ease. These horses are known for their natural pacing gait called "t√∂lt," which provides a smooth and comfortable ride even over long distances. Endurance is one of the Mongolian horse`s defining characteristics. It can cover vast distances without tiring quickly, making it ideal for long journeys and the traditional sport of horse racing. Naadam, Mongolia`s annual festival, includes horse racing as one of its primary events, showcasing the exceptional speed and stamina of these horses. The bond between the Mongolian people and their horses runs deep in their cultural fabric. Nomadic families rely on these steeds for transportation, herding livestock, and even as sources of food and clothing. The Mongolian horse`s ability to graze on sparse vegetation allows it to thrive in an environment where other livestock might struggle.',

In Mongolian tradition, whipping a person and whipping the ground with a whip is forbidden, but if a man finds a whip in the field, it is considered a blessing of luck. In the 13th century, Chinggis Khan accompanied his brothers on their journey to ask for help from Wang Khan of Keraiates, who prayed that the whip would be successful in many deeds, and soon after, Great Mongolia was established. Also, the place where the whip was found was named Tsonjin Boldog, and the world's largest horse statue, the Great Emperor Genghis Khan's equestrian statue complex, was built in 2008.",
