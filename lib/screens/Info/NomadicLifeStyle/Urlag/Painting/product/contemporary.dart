This period marked a departure from the predominantly religious and traditional themes of Mongolian art, introducing realism, impressionism, and later, abstract and experimental forms. The socialist era (1924-1990) greatly influenced Mongolian art, with the government promoting socialist realism as the dominant artistic style. Artists were encouraged to depict the achievements of socialism, the beauty of the Mongolian landscape, and the valor of its people, often in an idealized manner. However, beneath the surface of state-commissioned works, a desire for artistic freedom and individual expression began to emerge.',
