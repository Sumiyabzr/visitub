                    'The tradition of mural painting and rock art in Mongolia extends back thousands of years, with petroglyphs and pictographs found across the country. These artworks, etched or painted on natural rock surfaces, depict a wide range of subjects, including animals, human figures, hunting scenes, and symbolic motifs. The rock art of Mongolia, particularly prominent in sites like the Altai Mountains and the Gobi desert, reflects the shifting cultures and lifestyles of the region, from nomadic hunter-gatherers to early settled communities. Murals, on the other hand, became significant with the introduction of Buddhism to Mongolia around the 12th century. Buddhist monasteries and temples were adorned with elaborate murals depicting the Buddha, bodhisattvas, and various deities, serving both a decorative and instructional purpose. These murals played a crucial role in the spread and entrenchment of Buddhist teachings in Mongolia, creating a visual narrative of the religion`s cosmology and ethical tenets.',
