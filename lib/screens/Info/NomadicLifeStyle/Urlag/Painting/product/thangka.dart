The creation of a thangka involves several stages, starting with the preparation of the canvas, sketching the design, and then carefully applying natural pigments made from minerals and organic materials. Every aspect of a thangka, from the colors used to the posture and attributes of the figures depicted, is loaded with symbolic meaning and intended to convey specific teachings or aspects of the Buddhist philosophy. Artisans who create thangkas are highly skilled and often undergo years of training under the guidance of master artists. The creation of a thangka is considered a form of meditation and a meritorious act, with artists working in a consecrated space and often engaging in prayer or recitation of mantras during the process.',
